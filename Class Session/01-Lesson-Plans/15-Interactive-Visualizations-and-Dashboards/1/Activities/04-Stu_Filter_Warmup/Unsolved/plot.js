// @TODO: Complete the Following Steps

// Filter the top 15 cities with a population increase greater than 15,000
//  and then graph each city on the x-axis and the respective population on the y-axis.

// 1. Use the filter method to create a custom filtering function
//  that returns the cities with a population increase greater than 15,000.

function filterCities(city) {
    //Add your code
  }
  
  // 2. Use filter() to pass the function as its argument
  
  
  //  Check to make sure your filtered your cities.
  
  
  // 3. Use the map method with the arrow function to return all the filtered cities.
  
  
  //  Check your filtered cities
  
  
  // 4. Use the map method with the arrow function to return all the filtered cities population.
  
  
  //  Check the populations of your filtered cities
  
  
  
  // 5. Create your trace.

  
  // 6. Create the data array for our plot
  
  
  // 7. Define our plot layout

  
  // 8. Plot the chart to a div tag with id "bar-plot"
