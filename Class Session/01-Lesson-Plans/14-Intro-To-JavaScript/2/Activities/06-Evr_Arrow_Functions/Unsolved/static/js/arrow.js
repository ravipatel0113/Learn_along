// An Arrow function is a new concise syntax for function
// Arrow functions allow us to drop the `function` keyword and just show the parameters.
// Note: The fat arrow `=>` that was added to indicate an arrow function.


// We can drop the parentheses around the parameter if there's only one of them,
// but if we include the return keyword we must surround the return statement with curly braces.


// And finally, we can just drop the `return` keyword. The return is implied.


// Functions with more than one parameter still need the parenthesis


// We can also drop the curly braces here


// Map and Arrow makes it really easy to build an array of values for an
// array of objects




// Challenge Activity!
var princesses = [

  { name: "Mulan", age: 16 },
  { name: "Anna", age: 18 },

];

// log the name of each princess, follow by a colon, followed by their age
// forEach: executes a provided function once for each array element


// create an array of just the names from the princesses array
// map: creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array
