# Grid Search and Hyper-Parameter Tuning

* In this activity, you will revisit the SVM activity for the Pima Diabetes DataSet and apply `GridSearchCV` to tune the model parameters.

## Instructions

* Use the starter code provided and apply `GridSearchCV` to the model. Change the `C` and `gamma` parameters.

* For `C`, use the following list of settings: `[1, 5, 10]`.

* For `gamma`, use the following list of settings: `[0.0001, 0.001, 0.01]`.

* Print the best parameters and best score for the tuned model.

* Calculate predictions using the `X_test` data and print the classification report.
